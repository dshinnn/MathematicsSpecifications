<p align="center"><strong>This is a school project which required us to create a program that would prompt for an mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, division, mulitplication, absolute value, square root, quadratic, pythagorean) and returns the results.</strong>
</p>
<h2>About</h2>
    This school project demonstrated the usage of conditional statements.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

<strong>Goal:</strong> Create an application that allows users to select one of the eight mathematical operation and return the results.

<strong>Requirements: </strong>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to select a mathematical operation</li>
  <li>Perform selected operation</li>
  <li>Return results</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Conditional Statements

<h2>Installation</h2>

1. Download or copy the code in the main.c
2. Import it in a C++ IDE or use an online source (https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
